## Installation


### Manual



## Hints

* To present data downloaded by this sensor use companion card: [*Lovelace Google Keep card*](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/Lovelace-Google-Keep-card)

* If you define more than one constraint (`titles`, `labels`, `pinned`) all of them will be applied and intersection of results will be returned.

* **Do I have to use my Google Account password?**

  You can set up an App Password to use this component.
  * Go to [https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
  * In `Select app` menu choose `other` and provide your own identifier (e.g. `Home Assistant`)
  * Use generated password in sensor configuration (**Warning:** password will not be shown again!)
  

* **What to do if Home Assistant does not find this component?**

  Most likely you have to install additional dependency required for it to run. Activate Python environment Home Assistant is running in and use following command:
  ```bash
  pip install gkeepapi
  ```
